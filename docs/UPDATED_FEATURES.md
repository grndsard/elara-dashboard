# Elara Enterprise Features Update

## üöÄ Latest Enterprise Improvements

### ‚úÖ Security Enhancements
- **Enhanced CSP Policy**: Removed unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval for production security
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS protection with automatic input cleaning and logging
- **Tiered Rate Limiting**: 
  - Authentication: 10 requests/15min
  - File Upload: 5 requests/min
  - General API: 500 requests/15min
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, size limits, filename sanitization

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Observability
- **Correlation IDs**: Request tracing across all services and logs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking with slow request alerts (>1000ms)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Automatic alerts when heap usage exceeds 500MB
- **Comprehensive Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint with service status and metrics
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs and log rotation

### ‚úÖ Reliability Improvements
- **Database Connection Retry**: Exponential backoff with 3 retry attempts
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Production-safe error responses with detailed logging
- **Environment Validation**: Startup validation of required configuration
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Real-time status of all microservices

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimizations
- **Request Performance Tracking**: Response time monitoring and alerting
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Proactive memory leak detection
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file management (10MB max, 5 files)
- **Health Check Optimization**: Excluded from rate limiting for monitoring tools

## üìä New Endpoints

### Health Check Endpoint
```http
GET /health
```
**Response includes:**
- Service status (database, Python services)
- Response times for each service
- Memory usage metrics
- Application uptime
- Environment information

## üîß Configuration Updates

### New Environment Variables
```env
# Performance & Monitoring
DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
DB_TIMEOUT=60000
LOG_LEVEL=info
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=3000

# Security
HTTPS_ENABLED=false
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=500
```

## üìà Monitoring Capabilities

### Request Tracing
- Every request gets a unique correlation ID
- Full request lifecycle tracking
- Cross-service request correlation

### Performance Metrics
- Response time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Slow request detection
- Service health monitoring

### Security Monitoring
- XSS attempt detection and logging
- File upload validation logging
- Rate limiting violation tracking
- Authentication failure monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Improvements

### Input Protection
- Automatic XSS sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- File type validation
- Filename sanitization

### Enhanced Headers
- Strict CSP without unsafe directives
- HSTS with preload
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility
All improvements are fully backward compatible with existing:
- API endpoints
- Database schema
- Configuration files
- Client applications

## üìã Verification Steps

1. **Health Check**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
2. **Logs**: Check `logs/combined.log` for correlation IDs
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times in logs
4. **Security**: Verify CSP headers in browser dev tools
5. **Rate Limiting**: Test authentication endpoint limits
